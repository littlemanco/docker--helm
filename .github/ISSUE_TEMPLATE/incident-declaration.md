  *** WARNING ***

  This kicks of an emergency response process that, once kicked off, cannot be stopped. It requires:

  - An emergency point of contact available until the incident is in temporary resolution
  - A developer available until the incident is in temporary resolution
  - A post mortem
  - Incident follow up meetings until all contributing factors are closed.

  If you are looking for an immediate reaction, this is the correct issue to raise. If the issue can be resolved
  as part of a normal development workflow and is not urgent, please raise a bug ticket instead.
